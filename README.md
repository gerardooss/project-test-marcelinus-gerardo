Hi there. I am Marcelinus Gerardo, one of the Suitmedia FE Intern 2024 participants. I have already completed the given test. However, there is an issue with this submission. I can't retrieve the image from the given URL. I received an error like this

```
<Error>
<Code>AccessDenied</Code>
<Message>Access Denied</Message>

</Error>
```

Ultimately, in this submission, I use an static url as an image taken from [here](https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1334737130/photo/handshake-for-the-new-agreement.jpg?s=612x612&w=0&k=20&c=wJvcB4xnQ5U0chNnGbscyuOjXil5hVgBOrio86TpRNk=).

Thank you.
